# Realtime-sign-talk
 Real time sign language translation using deep learning -ANN ALGORITHM 
 I used a custom dataset that underwent preprocessing and transformed into a pickle format.
 I trained it using an ANN algorithm to create a deep learning model capable of translating sign language into English.
 Front end of the project is HTML and CSS and back end used is python.
 framework used is flask
